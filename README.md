# Tic Tac Toe

## Functionality

This is Tic Tac Toe - JavaScript project, where I create a Tic Tac Toe game, playable in the browser.

This game can be played by two person or single person. The time any square boxes is clicked X is marked and then player O clicks that’s how play goes on. This is human vs human game play. The result is displaying after if the match draw and if the match won by any of the player, the winner is displayed.

## Synopsis
* Allow multi-player

* Include button to reset board at any time during game

## Instructions to Play

When the game ends, 
it displays one of the following two outcomes:
